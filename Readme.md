## 3 design decisions that made, as a perceptual consideration for the user

Our project involved crucial design decisions aimed at enhancing the perceptual experience for users in the virtual environment. Below are three significant decisions we made:

### 1. Distance Attenuation
- **Description**: Implemented distance attenuation to ensure that sound intensity decreases as a user moves away from the source.
- **Purpose**: This feature mimics the natural behavior of sound in real-world settings, enhancing spatial awareness and providing a realistic auditory experience that aids in navigation within the virtual environment.

### 2. Directional Audio Effects
- **Description**: Integrated directional audio effects to vary sound based on its origin relative to the userâ€™s position.
- **Purpose**: This helps users determine the location of sound sources, significantly improving their ability to interact with and respond to different elements in the environment. It supports a more immersive experience by aligning auditory cues with visual perceptions, enhancing the overall realism of the virtual space.

### 3. Customizable Audio Settings
- **Description**: Provided a feature that allows users to adjust audio settings according to their personal preferences and needs.
- **Purpose**: This design decision enables users to tailor the auditory experience to their liking, accommodating a wide range of auditory sensitivities and preferences. It ensures that the environment is accessible and enjoyable for all users, making the virtual space more adaptable and user-friendly.
